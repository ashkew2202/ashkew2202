## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ Stuff I mess with: AI/ML, Kubernetes, KubeVirt, VMs, K8s networking, and servers that donâ€™t go down (most of the time).
- ğŸŒ± Currently digging into: Math behind AI/ML, DSA grind, and backend stacks (Gin, Django, Node) to wire everything together.
- ğŸ‘¯ Would team up with: A frontend guy
- ğŸ¤” Biggest bug: Academics ğŸ’€.
- ğŸ“« Ping me at: anshpmk@proton.me
- âš¡ Fun fact: Once made an AI to predict exam performance â€” turns out life is just equations with bad boundary conditions.
